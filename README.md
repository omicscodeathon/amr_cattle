# Investigating Antimicrobial Resistance Genes in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania Cattles Using Metagenomics

This is a comparative study of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) genes found in East African countries (Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania).

## Introduction

The emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global public health issue that jeopardises the efficiency of antimicrobials to cure animal infections that threatens their health, welfare and productivity.The project involves comparative study to identify antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes (resistomes) in the cattle microbiota from Kenya,Uganda and Tanzania. The understanding of circulating resistomes is important since management of cattle becomes difficult with disease burden which in turn leads to a decline in production as well as an increase in production costs and thus threatens the East Africa Community (EAC) economic growth agenda. In this case, it is imperative to understand what resistomes exist within the member states together with their genetic and genetic environmental basis underlying the resistomes. This is to better manage the livestock for maximisation of production and lowering risk and production costs. It will also aid in stakeholders further improving the standardisation protocols that govern the movement of products that are derived from cattle as well as govern veterinarians on informed decision on how to better manage their disease incidences.

## General Objective
- To compare AMR genes diversity in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania
