# Notice that mapping percentage is low (<50%) for some samples. This is a potential problem,  meaning that most reads are not represented in the assembly
# You could redo your analysis using assignment of the raw reads instead of relying on the assembly. Use sqm_reads.pl or sqm_longreads.pl for this purpose. That strategy will not provide bins
